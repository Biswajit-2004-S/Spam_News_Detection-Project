# Spam_News_Detection-Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake. In an age where misinformation spreads rapidly online, this tool can help flag potentially false news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview
The core objective is to analyze the content of a news article and determine whether it is genuine or spam (fake). The model was trained on a dataset of over 25,000 labeled news samples consisting of both real and fake news entries, making it well-equipped to detect deceptive patterns in news language and structure.

## Key Features
Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process and understand news content

Trained on a diverse dataset of 25,000+ real and fake news articles

Implements standard preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization

Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
