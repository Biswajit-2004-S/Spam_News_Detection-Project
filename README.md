# Spam_News_Detection-Project
This project focuses on building a machine 
learning model capable of detecting whether a 
given news article is genuine or fake. Using a 
dataset of over 25,000 labeled news entries — 
both real and fake — the model was trained 
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
techniques and evaluated for performance. This 
type of application is crucial in today's digital 
world where misinformation and fake news can 
spread rapidly through various media channels.
